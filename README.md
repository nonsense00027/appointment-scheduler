# Project Overview

1. Utilized a harmonious color palette, primarily consisting of shades of blue, black, and white, ensuring a visually cohesive user experience.
2. Employed flex positioning to transform appointments into responsive cards, ensuring optimal usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
3. Enhanced the content structure of the appointment card to optimize user comprehension and achieve a contemporary and aesthetically pleasing design.
4. Replaced repetitive note badges with a more user-friendly call-to-action feature for adding or viewing notes, which is ideally displayed through a modal/dialog component.
5. Implemented a floating action button for adding appointments, a design element commonly found on modern websites, contributing to a clean and intuitive user interface.
6. Adapted the filter functionality to a sidebar format for mobile views, while stacking horizontally to ensure responsiveness.
7. Incorporated responsive breakpoints to accommodate small, medium, and large screens, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

It is important to note that while the icons on the appointment cards appear static, they are for design representation and are not currently interactive.
